These are random java programs from mooc.fi Java tutorial and other online sources.
Some are not completed codes, because as I was attempting them I figured there were concepts beyond what I learned at the time.
I will probably make description of each file but for now it seems heavy work.
Also I am learning XML, heard it is good for programs layout.
Adios for now....
